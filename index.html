     Hi! My name is John Remeto. I am currently a lab technician for the aerospace manufacturer Cascade Gasket. I graduated from Linfield College with my bachelors of Science in Chemistry and leverage my knowledge in my current role as a Lab Technician to evaluate elestomeric materials and provide my company with a resource center for any elestomeric questions. I am currently enrolled in UW's coding bootcamp and plan on moving into a new role doing webdevelopment. Growing up I would attend videogame summer camps at Digipen, spending my summer coding games. I would later go on to take a few more coding classes in college. These experience pushed me to dive into UW's coding bootcamp and make the effort to change career paths. In my free time I try and stay active and engaged by practicing martial arts. Currently I train in 3 different martial arts, Jeet Kun Do, Jui Jistu, and kickboxing. This keeps my mind stimulated with fun but physically demanding activities. I hope to one day compete in MMA and Kickboxing.
